# [üï∫ Dance to Debug üíÉ ] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [farhan team]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [mohamed farhan k s] - [college of engineering and management punnapara]

### Project Description
[A revolutionary coding environment that locks your code editor until you perform a silly dance in front of your webcam. Because why should debugging be boring when you can make it embarrassing?]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Programmers are becoming too sedentary and serious! There's a critical shortage of dancing in the development workflow. Developers can write code without any physical activity, leading to a tragic decline in office entertainment and spontaneous dance parties.
]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We created an AI-powered dance detection system that holds your code hostage until you bust a move! Using advanced computer vision, our app analyzes your dance skills and only unlocks the code editor after you've sufficiently embarrassed yourself in front of your webcam. It's like a fitness tracker, but for your dignity!

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:

Languages: JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
Frameworks: Vanilla JS (because we're hardcore), CSS Grid/Flexbox
Libraries:

MediaPipe Pose Detection (Google's ML magic)
Monaco Editor (VS Code's editor engine)
WebRTC APIs for camera access


Tools:

Chrome DevTools (for debugging the debugger)
GitHub Pages (for deployment)
VS Code (ironically, the thing we're trying to replace)



For Hardware:

Main Components:

Any device with a webcam (laptop, desktop, phone)
Modern web browser with camera permissions


Specifications:

Camera: Minimum 480p resolution
RAM: 4GB+ (for smooth dancing detection)
CPU: Any modern processor (dancing is CPU intensive!)


Tools Required:

Two functional arms (for optimal dance detection)
Shamelessness (critical component)
Rhythm (optional, but recommended)
### Implementation
For Software:

# Installation
[comm# Installation
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dance-to-debug.git
cd dance-to-debug

# No dependencies! Just pure web technologies
# (Because we're not like other developers)ands]

# Run
[# Run
# Option 1: Python server
python -m http.server 8000

# Option 2: Node.js server  
npx http-server

# Option 3: Live Server (VS Code extension)
# Right-click index.html -> "Open with Live Server"

# Then visit: http://localhost:8000
# Start dancing and coding! üï∫üíÉ]
